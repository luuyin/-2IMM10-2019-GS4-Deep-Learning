        "In this practical we will look at how to design a convolutional autoencoder architecture. For the encoder, we can use similar architectures as for common classification/regression networks (e.g. VGG-style). Typically, the decoder is then designed to \"reverse\" the structure of the encoder. For fully connected layers this is straightforward, but for convolutional or pooling layers this leaves some options."

        "For our decoder architecture, it seems natural to reverse the structure of the encoder, layer by layer. We could try some weight-tying between encoder and decoder, but typically this is not done; the encoder and decoder each have their own weights that are trained independently.\n",

However, this is prone to creating unwanted artifacts, or the checkerboard effect (see https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/ for an excellent explanation). Therefore, we prefer to not use strided convolutions in the encoder, and we use MaxPooling to downsample the size of the activation maps. To reverse this downsampling, we can use the UpSampling layer in Keras (which is essentially nearest-neighbour interpolation as described and recommended in https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/). To \"reverse\" a non-strided convolution, we can then simply use another normal convolution, where we use the number of input activation maps (filters) in of the encoder conv-layer as the number of output activation maps (filters) for the decoder conv-layer.\n",
