    "2. Given an image with multiple text descriptions, how to represent this pair of data as model input-output?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the answer in a notation (x, y) or clear description that guarantees you can run the same model with your input-output representation. Name all the input(s) and output(s) of the model.\n",
    "- How does the model extract image features from raw images? Name and briefly explain how to employ the feature extractor. Include the dimension (array shape) of the extracted features.\n",
    "- How are the train descriptions represented into the model? Why do we need to add “starting” and “ending” token of every caption in a preprocessing stage?\n",
    "- How does the model initialize RNN states for caption generator? What is being fed into the decoder states in the first time step (t = 0)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the motivation of incorporating Beam Search in Sequence-to-Sequence learning? Briefly explain how the method works in an inference stage."
